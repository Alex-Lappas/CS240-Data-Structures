I HAVE FOLLOWED THE STEPS SEPARATING THEM IN DIFFERENT DIRECTORIES INCLUDING A README.TXT IN EACH ONE THAT FINISHES A MAJOR EVENT 
THIS WAY I CAN HELP YOU MARK THE PROJECT EVEN IF I AM UNABLE TO COMPLETE ALL OF IT. IF THE GENERAL DIR FILES DONT COMPILE PLEASE TRACE BACK TO STEPS FOLLOWING THE READMES.
UNLESS I HAVE FORGOTEN TO DO SOMETHING EVERYTHING SHOULD RUN PERFECT EXCEPT FOR NOTICED PROBLMES: 

- D PRINT IS OFF.
-FREE ACTS WEIRD BUT I WAS EXPECTING THAT.

*G *S USE IS GLOBAL

IT IS IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THAT I HAVE ADJUSTED THE INDEXES IN A WAY SO THAT THERE IS NO TEAM 0 . TEAMS HAVE AN ID AND AN INDEX TO SUB OR INSERT TO FROM 1 TO 64

DISCLAIMER: I HAVE MIXED DECLARATIONS AND C++ STYLE COMMENTS AT SOME POINTS WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM UNLESS YOU USE A FLAG THAT MAKES IT ONE. IF SO, PLEASE SPARE 
MY LIFE AND DONT USE IT FOR THE SHAKE OF MAKING SURE THAT THE CODE RUNS <3
